# Sharp Menu Lite
Sharp Menu is the Options Menu originally seen in FNF#. It is designed to be easy to use and modify using just a singular array.

This is Sharp Menu Lite, the same menu but on it's own.
Feel free to copy this into your own projects with credit.

To use it, copy source/SharpMenuState.hx and assets/data/SharpMenuConfig.json into your own project.

This menu is not officially supported, and improvements made to FNF#'s version of the menu will likely not be carried over.
